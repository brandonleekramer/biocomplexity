# UVA Biocomplexity (Select Works)

In this repo, I share a select number of works I completed while at UVA's Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative. 

## Fairfax  

In this project, my colleagues and I worked county government officials to develop a project that would help combat health disparities and boost economic mobility for underserved communities in Fairfax County, VA.

## OSS

In this project, my colleagues and I used web scraping, APIs and network analysis to analyze the growth of open-source software on GitHub. These files show my ability to use text analysis tools for restructuring data; using SQL to read, write and restructure data tables; and to conduct basic descriptive analyses on a network of 3 million nodes and 9 million edges.
