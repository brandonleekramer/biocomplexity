# UVA Biocomplexity (Select Works)

In this repo, I share a select number of works I have worked on while at UVA's Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative. 

## Fairfax  

In this project, my colleagues and I worked county government officials to develop a project that would help combat health disparities and boost economic mobility for underserved communities in Fairfax County, VA. Below is an example of how we have used network analysis to identify gaps in previous work on Fairfax County.

## OSS

In this project, my colleagues and I used web scraping and network analysis to analyze the growth of open-source software on GitHub. These files show my ability to use text analysis tools for restructuring data; using SQL to read, write and restructure data tables; and to conduct basic descriptive analyses on a network of 3 million nodes and 9 million edges. Here are some preliminary results for the year-by-year and cumulative networks (no write-up yet):
